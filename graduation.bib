A brief description of the formulations used for modeling heat transfer and for determining the thermodynamic state is presented. Code performance is verified through comparison to experimental data for the self-pressurization of scale-model liquid hydrogen tanks. SOLA-ECLIPSE is used to examine the effect of initial subcooling of the liquid phase on the self-pressurization rate of an on-orbit full-scale liquid hydrogen tank typical for a chemical-propulsion orbit transfer vehicle. The computational predictions show that even small amounts of subcooling will significantly decrease the self-pressurization rate. Further, if the cooling is provided by a thermodynamic vent system, it is concluded that small levels of subcooling will maximize propellant conservation.},

abstract = {Self-pressurization phenomenon is one of the most important problems in the storage of cryogenic liquid. Until now, it has been difficult to predict exact pressurization process due to its complex non-equilibrium thermal behavior. This paper analyzes the self-pressurization with the trend of pressurization curves from experiment using liquid nitrogen with various heat leaks and liquid fractions. The trend of pressurization curves are classified on the basis of shape of pressurization curve. The qualitative relation between transient period, heat leak and liquid fractions is suggested. Thermal diffusion model (TDM) considering thermal stratification and thermal equilibrium model (TEM) can properly predict the respective pressurization curves with suitable condition for each model. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Future operations of many fluid, thermal and power systems and their ability to store, transfer, and manage a variety of single or multiphase fluids in reduced gravity environment are of great importance. For many of these systems, cryogenic conditions will play an important role. Cryogenic vaporization, caused by heat leakage into the tank from the surrounding environment, is one of the main causes of mass loss and leads to self-pressurization of the storage tanks. Available publications on self-pressurization and stratification of cryogenic tanks mainly focus on the convection and surface evaporation influences. Because large superheats increase the likelihood of evaporation in the liquid, the evaporation and its effect on vapor pressure under microgravity is studied numerically in this paper. The effects of reduced gravity, contact angle of the vapor bubble, and surface tension are investigated. The computations are carried out by using the CFD software package, Ansys Fluent, and an in-house developed code to calculate the source term associated with the phase change. A coupled level set and the volume-of-fluid method (CLSVOF) are used to solve a single set of conservation equations for the whole domain and the interface between the two phases is tracked or captured. A heat and mass transfer model is implemented into the Fluent code for solving problems involving evaporation or condensation. Results show that small tiny vapor regions caused by the evaporation process change the pressure rise. Vortices are observed due to the vapor dynamics.},

Therefore, its technol. was applied for a conversion of biomass to useful fuels and chems. so as to mitigate the environmental loading.  For example, supercrit. or subcrit. water treatment has demonstrated that lignocellulosics can be decompd. to be lignin-derived products for useful arom. chems. and carbohydrate-derived products for subsequent ethanol fermn. as well as acetic acid fermn. to produce bioethanol.  If this treatment is prolonged, lignocellulosics were found to be converted to org. acids which can be further converted to methane as one of the useful biofuels.  If alcs. such as methanol, ethanol etc. are used in their supercrit. condition for lignocellulosics, some other useful products were achieved and its liquefied products were found to have a potential as liq. biofuel, while methanol for oils and fats are used, biodiesel can be produced under non-catalytic conditions.  In addn., a potential of carboxylate ester and di-Me carbonate in supercrit. state for biodiesel prodn. has been also demonstrated.

abstract = {An analysis is carried out for the ghost fluid method (GFM) based algorithm as applied to the gas-water Riemann problems, which can be construed as two single-medium GFM Riemann problems. It is found that the inability to provide correct and consistent Riemann waves in the respective real fluids by these two GFM Riemann problems may lead to inaccurate numerical results. Based on this finding, two conditions are suggested and imposed for the ghost fluid status in order to ensure that correct and consistent Riemann waves are provided in the respective real fluids during the numerical decomposition of the singularity. Using these two conditions to analyse some of the existing GFM-based algorithms such as the original GFM [J. Comput. Phys. 152 (1999) 457], the new version GFM [J. Comput. Phys. 166 (2001) 1; J. Comput. Phys. 175 (2002) 200] and the modified GFM (MGFM) [J. Comput. Phys. 190 (2003) 651], it is found that there are ranges of conditions for each type of solution where either the original GFM or the new version GFM or both are unable to provide correct or consistent Riemann waves in one of the real fluids. Within these ranges, examples can be found such that either the original GFM or the new version GFM or both are unable to provide accurate results. The MGFM is also found to encounter difficulties when applied to nearly cavitating flow. Various examples are presented to demonstrate the conclusions obtained. The MGFM with proposed modification when applied to nearly cavitating flow is then found to be quite robust and can provide relatively reasonable results. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional model has been developed of droplet impact onto asymmetric surface geometries. The model is based on RIPPLE, and combines a fixed-grid control volume discretization of the flow equations with a volume tracking algorithm to track the droplet free surface. Surface tension is modeled as a volume force acting on fluid near the free surface. Contact angles are applied as a boundary condition at the contact line. The results of two scenarios are presented, of the oblique impact of a 2 mm water droplet at 1 m/sec onto a 45° incline, and of a similar impact of a droplet onto a sharp edge. Photographs are presented of such impacts, against which the numerical results are compared. The contact angle boundary condition is applied in one of two ways. For the impact onto an incline, the temporal variation of contact angles at the leading and trailing edges of the droplet was measured from photographs. This data is applied as a boundary condition to the simulation, and an interpolation scheme proposed to evaluate contact angles between the leading and trailing edges. A simpler model is then proposed, for contact angle as a function of contact line velocity, and applied to both geometries. The model requires values of only two contact angles, at a rapidly advancing and a rapidly receding contact line. Simulation results compare well with photographic data.},

abstract = {With its roots in kinetic theory and the cellular automaton concept, the lattice-Boltzmann (LB) equation can be used to obtain continuum flow quan-tities from simple and local update rules based on particle interactions. The simplicity of formulation and its versatility explain the rapid expansion of the LB method to applications in complex and multiscale flows. We review many significant developments over the past decade with specific examples. Some of the most active developments include the entropic LB method and the application of the LB method to turbulent flow, multiphase flow, and deformable particle and fiber suspensions. Hybrid methods based on the combination of the Eulerian lattice with a Lagrangian grid system for the simulation of moving deformable boundaries show promise for more efficient applications to a broader class of problems. We also discuss higher-order boundary conditions and the simulation of microchannel flow with finite Knudsen number. Additionally, the remarkable scalability of the LB method for parallel processing is shown with examples. Teraflop simulations with the LB method are routine, and there is no doubt that this method will be one of the first candidates for petaflop computational fluid dynamics in the near future.},

Different from other analytical approximate methods, the HAM is totally independent of small physical parameters, and thus it is suitable for most nonlinear problems. The HAM provides us a great freedom to choose basis functions of solution series, so that a nonlinear problem can be approximated more effectively, and it adjusts and controls the convergence region and the convergence rate of the series solution through introducing auxiliary parameter and the auxiliary function. The HAM hews out a new approach to the analytical approximate solutions of capillary flow in a circular tube. Through the specific example and comparing homotopy approximate analytical solution with the numerical solution which is obtained by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, the computed result indicate that this method has the good computational accuracy. 锛},

abstract = {LCH4 testing was conducted at the Marshall Space Flight Center using the multipurpose hydrogen test bed (MHTB) to evaluate the performance of a spray-bar thermodynamic vent system (TVS) with subcooled LCH4 and gaseous helium (GHe) pressurant. Thirteen days of testing were performed in November 2006, with total tank heat leak conditions of about 715 W and 420 W at a fill level of approximately 90{\%}. A total of 23 TVS cycles were completed. The TVS successfully controlled the ullage pressure within a prescribed control band but did not maintain a stable liquid saturation pressure. This was likely due to a TVS design not optimized for this particular propellant and test conditions, and possibly due to a large artificially induced heat input directly into the liquid. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This treatment provides a unified theory of lattice Boltzmann models for nonideal gases. The lattice Boltzmann equation is systematically obtained by discretizing the Enskog equation in phase space and time. The lattice Boltzmann model derived in this paper is thermodynamically consistent up to the order of discretization error. Existing lattice Boltzmann models for nonideal gases are analyzed and compared in detail. An evaluation of these models is made in light of the general procedure to construct the lattice Boltzmann model for nonideal gases presented in this work.},

abstract = {Abstract: Understanding the stability of fluid interfaces subjected to small vibrations under microgravity conditions is important for designing future materials science experiments to be conducted aboard orbiting spacecraft. During the STS-85 mission, experiments investigating the motion of a large bubble resulting from small, controlled vibrations were performed aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery. To better understand the experimental results, two-and three-dimensional simulations of the experiment were performed using level set and volume-of-fluid interface tracking algorithms. The simulations proved capable of predicting accurately the experimentally determined bubble translation behavior. Linear dependence of the bubble translation amplitude on the container translation amplitude was confirmed. In addition, the simulation model was used to confirm predictions of a theoretical inviscid model of bubble motion developed in a previous study.},

abstract = {A two-fluid lattice Boltzmann model for binary mixtures is developed. The model is derived formally from kinetic theory by discretizing two-fluid Boltzmann equations in which mutual collisions and self-collisions are treated independently. In the resulting lattice Boltzmann model, viscosity and diffusion coefficients can be varied independently by a suitable choice of mutual- and self-collision relaxation-time scales. Further, the proposed model can simulate miscible and immiscible fluids by changing the sign of the mutual-collision term. This is in contrast to most existing single-fluid lattice Boltzmann models that employ a single-relaxation-time scale and hence are restricted to unity Prandtl and Schmidt numbers. The extension of binary mixing model to multiscalar mixing is quite straightforward},

abstract = {A simple coupled Volume of Fluid (VOF) with Level Set (LS) method (S-CLSVOF) for improved surface tension implementation is proposed and tested by comparison against a standard VOF solver and experimental observations. A CFD Open source solver library (OpenFOAM{\textregistered}) is used for the VOF method, where the volume fraction is advected algebraically using a compressive scheme. This method has been found not to be suitable for problems with high surface tension effects and it is extended by coupling it with a LS method which is used to calculate the surface tension and the interface curvature. Two test cases; a circular bubble at equilibrium and a free bubble rise, are studied first to examine the accuracy of the S-CLSVOF method. The problem of 3D axi-symmetrical air bubble injection into quiescent water using different volumetric flow rates is then considered to assess the method under challenging capillary dominant conditions. An experimental study has been performed to validate the numerical methods with reference to the geometrical characteristics of the bubble during the full history of formation. The exponential power law controlling the detachment process is investigated. In addition, the influence of the static contact angle imposed at the rigid wall is considered. The results have shown that the coupling code (S-CLSVOF) improves the accuracy of the original VOF method when the surface tension influence is predominant. The two methods provide similar results during the detachment stage of the process due to the large increase of the gas inertia effect. Finally, the static contact angle boundary condition was shown to allow accurate modeling provided that the imposed static contact angle is less than the minimum instantaneous values observed experimentally. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper reports the observations of boiling flow patterns in FC-72, performed during a microgravity experiment, recently flown aboard of Foton-M2 satellite, in some instances with the additional aid of an electrostatic field to replace the buoyancy force. The heater consisted of a flat plate, 20 × 20 mm2, directly heated by direct current. Several levels of liquid subcooling (from 20 to 6 K) and heat fluxes up to 200 kW/m2 were tested. A complete counterpart test, carried out on ground before the mission, allowed direct comparison with terrestrial data. The void fraction in microgravity revealed much larger than in normal gravity condition: this may be attributed to increased bubble coalescence that hinders vapor condensation in the bulk of the subcooled fluid. In several cases, an oscillatory boiling behavior was detected, leading to periodical variation of average wall overheating of some degrees. The electric field confirmed to be very effective, even at low values of applied voltage, in reducing bubble size, thus improving their condensation rate in the bulk fluid, and in enhancing heat transfer performance, suppressing the boiling oscillations and preventing surface dryout. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {We present a sharp interface method for computing incompressible immiscible two-phase flows. It couples the level-set and volume-of-fluid techniques and retains their advantages while overcoming their weaknesses. It is stable and robust even for large density and viscosity ratios on the order of 1000 to 1. The numerical method is an extension of the second-order method presented by Sussman [M. Sussman, A second order coupled levelset and volume of fluid method for computing growth and collapse of vapor bubbles, Journal of Computational Physics 187 (2003) 110-136] in which the previous method treated the gas pressure as spatially constant and the present method treats the gas as a second incompressible fluid. The new method yields solutions in the zero gas density limit which are comparable in accuracy to the method in which the gas pressure was treated as spatially constant. This improvement in accuracy allows one to compute accurate solutions on relatively coarse grids, thereby providing a speed-up over continuum or "ghost-fluid" methods. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This article presents results for pool boiling heat transfer under microgravity conditions that the author and his team have gained in a succession of experiments during the past two decades. The objective of the research work was to provide answers to the following questions: Is boiling an appropriate mechanism of heat transfer for space application? How do heat transfer and bubble dynamics behave without the influence of buoyancy, or more general, without the influence of external forces? Is microgravity a useful environment for investigating the complex mechanisms of boiling with the aim of gaining a better physical understanding? Various carrier systems that allow simulation of a microgravity environment could be used, such as drop towers, parabolic trajectories with NASA's aircraft KC-135, ballistic rockets such as TEXUS, and, more recently, three Space Shuttle missions. As far as the possibilities of the respective missions allowed, a systematic research program was followed that was continuously adjusted to actual new parameters. After a general survey concerning the importance of boiling for technical applications, an introduction is given especially for those individuals not closely familiar with the fields of microgravity and boiling. Surprising results have been obtained: not only that saturated pool boiling can be maintained in a microgravity environment, but also that at small heater surfaces and lower values of heat fluxes, even higher heat transfer coefficients have been attained than under terrestrial conditions. The bubble departure can be attributed to surface tension effects, to “bubble ripening” and coalescence processes. Under subcooled conditions only, thermocapillary flow was observed that transports the heat from the bubble interface into the bulk liquid, but does not enhance the heat transfer compared with boiling at saturated conditions. Direct electrical heated plane surfaces lead to a slow extension of dry spots to dry areas below bubbles, the increasing surface temperature suggesting transition to film boiling. The critical heat flux in microgravity is lower than under earth conditions, but considerably higher than the hitherto accepted correlations predict when extrapolated to microgravity. The nearly identical heat transfer coefficients received for nucleate boiling under microgravity as well as terrestrial conditions, and for both saturated and subcooled fluid states, also suggest identical heat transfer mechanisms. These results lead to the conclusion that the primary heat transfer mechanism must be strongly related to the development of the microlayer during bubble growth. Secondary mechanisms are responsible for the transport of enthalpy in form of latent energy of the bubbles and hot liquid carried with them. Under terrestrial conditions, that mechanism is caused by external forces such as buoyancy; under microgravity conditions, the self dynamics of the bubbles and/or thermocapillary flow under subcooled conditions are responsible. The results demonstrate clearly that boiling can be applied as a heat transfer mechanism in a microgravity environment and that microgravity is a useful means to study the physics of boiling.},

Two boundary treatment schemes are incorporated to investigate their impacts to the entire flow field. We pay particular attention to the pressure and the slip velocity distributions along the channel in our simulation. We also look at the mass flow rate which is constant throughout the channel and the overall average velocity for the pressure-driven flow. In addition, we include a simulation of shear-driven flow in our results for verification. Our numerical results compare well with those obtained analytically and experimentally.

The above method allows for the direct incorporation of fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interactions as well as an applied external force. As a test of this method, we obtained Poiseuille flow for the case of a single fluid driven by a constant body force and obtained results consistent with Laplace's law for the case of two immiscible fluids. The displacement of one fluid by another in a porous medium was then modeled. The relative permeability for different wetting fluid saturations of a microtomography-generated image of sandstone was calculated and compared favorably with experiment.

abstract = {A conservative method of level set type for moving interfaces in divergence free velocity fields is presented. The interface is represented implicitly by the 0.5 level set of a function ?? being a smeared out Heaviside function, i.e., a function being zero on one side of the interface and one on the other. In a transition layer of finite, constant thickness ?? goes smoothly from zero to one. The interface is moved implicitly by the advection of ??, which is split into two steps. First ?? is advected using a standard numerical method. Then an intermediate step is performed to make sure that the smooth profile of ?? and the thickness of the transition layer is preserved. Both these steps are performed using conservative second order approximations and thus conserving ?????. In this way good conservation of the area bounded by the 0.5 contour of ?? is obtained.

In this paper, this common understanding is challenged. It is shown that an arbitrarily thin metamaterial layer can perfectly absorb or giantly amplify an incident plane wave at a critical angle when the real parts of the permittivity and permeability of the metamaterial are zero while the absolute imaginary parts can be arbitrarily small. The metamaterial layer needs a totally reflective substrate for perfect absorption, while this is not required for giant magnification. Detailed analysis for the existence of the critical angle and physical explanation for these abnormal phenomena are given.},

To minimize the losses, complicated insulation techniques are necessary. In general, Multi Layer Insulation (MLI) and a Vapor-Cooled Shield (VCS) are used together in LH2 tanks. In the design of an LH2 tank with VCS, the main goal is to find the optimum location for the VCS in order to minimize heat leakage. In this study, a 2D thermal model is developed by considering the temperature dependencies of the thermal conductivity and heat capacity of hydrogen gas. The developed model is used to analyze the effects of model considerations on heat leakage predictions. Furthermore, heat leakage in insulation of LH2 tanks with single and double VCS is analyzed for an automobile application, and the optimum locations of the VCS for minimization of heat leakage are determined for both cases. ?? 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

abstract = {Based on previous experiments and the volume of fluid (VOF) multiphase model, the growth characteristics of a single bubble have been numerically investigated in a rectangular pool (10??10??25 mm3) under microgravity. The transport of mass and energy during phase change was realized by source terms of the mass and energy equations through user-defined functions (UDF). Under microgravity, the results show that the temperature and the streamline field distribution around the bubble are significantly changed as compared to the ones of terrestrial conditions. The temperature profile at the two-phase interface is no longer a uniform distribution, and the Marangoni flows are more obvious at the two-phase interface. The effects of gravity on the detachment of the bubble are significant: the bubble does not immediately detach from the heating wall under microgravity conditions. The surface tension gradient caused by the Marangoni effect is more significant at lower microgravity. Bubble growth is more complex under microgravity conditions than normal gravity conditions, and it is related to the magnitude of the microgravity: the lower the microgravity, the higher the bubble growth rate. Furthermore, under microgravity, the bubble diameter changes differently, and the fluctuation amplitude of the heat transfer coefficient increases with increasing microgravity. ?? 2014 IAA.

A lumped thermodynamic model of the vapour region is coupled with the Navier–Stokes and energy equations governing heat, mass and momentum transport in the liquid. These equations are discretized using a Galerkin finite-element method with implicit time integration. Three case studies are considered based on three different heating configurations imposed on the tank wall: liquid heating, vapour heating and uniform heating. For each case, the pressure and temperature rise in the vapour and the flow and temperature distributions in the liquid are determined. Results are compared to a lumped thermodynamic model of the entire tank. It is shown that the final rate of pressure rise is about the same in each case and close to that predicted by thermodynamics even though the actual pressures are different because of varying degrees of thermal stratification. Finally, a subcooled liquid jet is used to mix the liquid and limit the pressure rise. Even so, there is still some thermal stratification in the liquid, and as a result the final vapour pressure depends on the particular heat distribution.},

abstract = {气液界面(自由液面)或者液液界面的流体力学问题广泛存在于自然界与工业生产实践中。流体的界面是一个相到另一个相之间很薄的过渡区域,分子间的相互作用力在这个过渡区域宏观上表现为表面张力,其大小一般是温度和浓度的函数。其中,流体界面上的非均匀温度引起的切向表面张力梯度会驱动流体流动,这种流动称为热毛细对流。在微重力或微尺度条件下,重力和浮力对流体流动的影响极度地减弱,热毛细流可能成为主要的对流。在热毛细对流问题中,温度梯度引起的非均匀表面张力即驱动流体流动又影响界面形状,这两者的动态耦合使热毛细对流的数值模拟成为计算流体动力学长期以来的一个重要挑战。基于格子Boltzmann方法(Lattice Boltzmann Method:LBM),本文发展了考虑界面动态变形的热毛细对流问题的计算方法,其中两种不相溶的流体流动采用多松弛不可压缩LBM方法模拟,界面的动态变形则采用相场法进行捕捉。通过自主开发的程序包,本文数值模拟研究了双液滴热毛细迁移与合并,以及双层环形液池内热毛细对流和界面变形耦合过程。本文的主要工作与贡献如下:(1)首先简要地介绍了LBM方法,推导了格子Boltzmann方程恢复到宏观Navier-Stokes方程的过程,并建立了不可压缩多松弛LBM模型。随后,对经典流动问题进行数值模拟,验证了多松弛不可压缩LBM基础模型及其程序的正确性。(2)基于上述LBM基础模型,建立了两种不同的耦合模型用于模拟考虑界面动态变形的等温两相流问题,两种模型中均采用LBM方法求解两相流流场,而界面运动则分别通过Front Tracking方法和相场法捕捉。最后基于OpenMP并行技术对自主开发的三维问题程序包实现并行计算。(3)在LBM耦合相场法模型中进一步引入能量方程研究热毛细对流问题。建立了轴对称坐标系下的LBM模型,两相流流场采用LBM进行模拟,相场方程和能量方程则采用有限差分法求解。在模型中根据相场方程得到的指示函数,通过引入界面力模型(Continuum Surface Force:CSF)实现法向和切向表面张力的计算。(4)系统地研究了双液滴的热毛细迁移及合并过程。首次通过数值模拟揭示了Marangoni数和Capillary数对两液滴合并过程的影响。研究表明在随Marangoni数增大,尾随液滴更难追上前导液滴并与之合并。此外,随Capillary数增大前导液滴的变形更明显,同样尾随液滴亦更难追上前导液滴并与之合并,同时液滴之间合并的持续时间也随Capillary数增大而增加。(5)系统地研究了多种因素对双层环形液池内热毛细对流和界面变形的影响。结果表明上层流体具有较大的密度或者粘性时,下层流体的流动强度被明显削弱,但液液界面的变形程度也随之增加。不同Capillary数对流动强度的影响较小但对界面变形的影响却非常明显。},

However, recent NASA mission investigations have looked at a different and broad array of missions, including a variety of orbit transfer vehicle (OTV) propulsion concepts, some requiring cryogenic storage. For many of the missions, this vehicle will remain for long periods (greater than one week) in low earth orbit (LEO), a relatively warm thermal environment. Under this environment, and with an array of tank sizes and propellants, the performance of a ZBO cryogenic storage system is predicted and compared with a traditional, passive-only storage concept. The results show mass savings over traditional, passive-only cryogenic storage when mission durations are less than one week in LEO for oxygen, two weeks for methane, and roughly 2 months for LH2.

abstract = {We introduce a new numerical method, called "SURFER," for the simulation of two- and three-dimensional flows with several fluid phases and free interfaces between them. We consider incompressible fluids obeying the Navier-Stokes equation with Newtonian viscosity in the bulk of each phase. Capillary forces are taken into account even when interfaces merge or break up. Fluid interfaces are advanced in time using an exactly volume conserving variant of the volume of fluid algorithm, thus allowing for full symmetry between fluid phases. The Navier-Stokes equation is solved using staggered finite differences on a MAC grid and a split-explicit time differencing scheme, while incompressibility is enforced using an iterative multigrid Poisson solver. Capillary effects are represented as a stress tensor computed from gradients of the volume fraction function. This formulation is completely independent of the topology of interfaces and relatively easy to implement in 3D. It also allows exact momentum conservation in the discretized algorithm. Numerical spurious effects or "parasite currents" are noticed and compared to similar effects in Boltzmann lattice gas methods for immiscible fluids. Simulations of droplets pairs colliding in 2D and in 3D are shown. Interface reconnection is performed easily, despite the large value of capillary forces during reconnection.},

abstract = {A simple coupled Volume of Fluid (VOF) with Level Set (LS) method (S-CLSVOF) for improved surface tension implementation is proposed and tested by comparison against a standard VOF solver and experimental observations. A CFD Open source solver library (OpenFOAM{\textregistered}) is used for the VOF method, where the volume fraction is advected algebraically using a compressive scheme. This method has been found not to be suitable for problems with high surface tension effects and it is extended by coupling it with a LS method which is used to calculate the surface tension and the interface curvature. Two test cases; a circular bubble at equilibrium and a free bubble rise, are studied first to examine the accuracy of the S-CLSVOF method. The problem of 3D axi-symmetrical air bubble injection into quiescent water using different volumetric flow rates is then considered to assess the method under challenging capillary dominant conditions. An experimental study has been performed to validate the numerical methods with reference to the geometrical characteristics of the bubble during the full history of formation. The exponential power law controlling the detachment process is investigated. In addition, the influence of the static contact angle imposed at the rigid wall is considered. The results have shown that the coupling code (S-CLSVOF) improves the accuracy of the original VOF method when the surface tension influence is predominant. The two methods provide similar results during the detachment stage of the process due to the large increase of the gas inertia effect. Finally, the static contact angle boundary condition was shown to allow accurate modeling provided that the imposed static contact angle is less than the minimum instantaneous values observed experimentally. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The method developed is notable in that it does not introduce any artificial smoothing of the change in fluid properties across the surface of discontinuity. This results in an increase in accuracy relative to methods which introduce smoothing effects. The method was also shown to be fairly versatile; problems describing a free surface, an immiscible fluid interface, and a premixed flame discontinuity were solved. There is a limitation, however, in that the method appears to be most suitable for application to inviscid problems.

abstract = {The continuum surface force (CSF) method has been extensively employed in the volume-of-fluid (VOF), level set (LS) and front tracking methods to model the surface tension force. It is a robust method requiring relatively easy implementation. However, it is known to generate spurious currents near the interface, which may lead to disastrous interface instabilities and failures of grid convergence. A different surface tension implementation algorithm, referred to as the pressure boundary method (PBM), is introduced in this study. The surface tension force is incorporated into the Navier-Stokes equation via a pressure gradient while the free surface is tracked by a coupled level set and volume-of-fluid (CLSVOF) method. It has been shown that the spurious currents are greatly reduced by the PBM method with the sharp pressure boundary condition preserved. The numerical results of several test cases have been obtained and are in close agreement with data reported in the literature. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Fluid transfer within a stagnant liquid presents a significant challenge in zero-gravity conditions due to the lack of buoyancy effects. This challenge can be overcome by the utilisation of the Marangoni effect, or more specifically thermocapillary migration. The thermocapillary migration of droplets is driven by temperature gradients within the multiphase system which bring about a surface tension gradient driving the flow from the cold to the hot region. The migration speed of the droplet is significantly impacted by the heat transfer both inside the droplet and in its surroundings. This paper presents the analysis of drop movement in a stagnant liquid using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The commercial software package Ansys-Fluent v.13 [1] is used to solve the governing continuum conservation equations for two-phase flow using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method to track the liquid/liquid interface in 2D domain. This approach has been shown to be a valuable tool for studying the phenomena of liquid-liquid interaction. A strong agreement has been found with experimental observations conducted in microgravity. The inherent velocity of drops has been found to decrease with increasing Marangoni number. This finding is in line with the previous space experiments of Xie et al. (2005) [2] and in contrast to the numerical results of Ma (1999) [3] using the same liquid for the droplet and the host liquid. Data obtained in the present numerical study has been used to derive an expression predicting the scaled droplet velocity as a function of Marangoni number. A numerical study of the interaction of two spherical droplets undergoing thermocapillary migration in microgravity is also presented. The temperature thrust from the leading droplet towards the trailing droplet was found to disturb its migration velocity, but the trailing droplet was found to have no influence on the migration of the leading droplet.},

abstract = {This chapter focuses on the effects of reduced gravity on heat transfer. The study of heat-transfer processes in reduced and zero gravity is of interest for reasons of both practical and basic research importance. To experimentally study reduced and very low gravity behavior, a facility is needed that will provide a specified gravity reduction with reasonable convenience. Some of these facilities have been reviewed and some pertinent characteristics are considered. Gravity or a similar-body force field appears in the analytical predictions and experimental correlations for free convection as a natural consequence of the buoyancy force being the defined driving potential for the flow. Pool boiling provides very high heat-transfer coefficients and, hence, can have useful applications in the high-performance heat-transfer devices employed in space applications. For low-gravity applications in a system where there is a net vapor generation, a difficulty, arising as a result of the low buoyancy force, is the separation of the vapor from the liquid. The discussion of condensation will begin with situations where there is no forced-flow pumping pressure applied to move either the liquid or the vapor so that the fluid motion is produced only by the gravity field. An interest in forced-flow condensation in reduced gravity stems from the design of electric-generating plants for space use. A system that shows some promise is a Rankine cycle turbogenerator unit that utilizes a liquid metal as the working fluid. Some combustion processes depend on gravity because free convection accounts for the circulation of some of the reactants into the flame zone. Studies in reduced gravity are important: (1) for specific applications in space devices, (2) to determine the validity of the gravity dependence in theoretical and experimental correlations, and (3) to remove unwanted effects of free convection in certain experiments.},

abstract = {We propose a new lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for two-phase fluid flows with high density ratios by improving Inamuro et??al.???s method [13] without solving the pressure Poisson equation. In the proposed method, we use the lattice kinetic scheme (LKS, an extended scheme of LBM) in the same way as Inamuro et??al.???s method. The velocity and pressure fields are computed by using a single equilibrium distribution function and by adjusting the speed of sound in a high density region to satisfy the incompressible continuity equation even for high density ratios. In addition, an improved LKS is used for eliminating dissipation errors, and the continuous surface force (CSF) model is used for modeling interfacial tension of thin interfaces accurately. In order to show the validity of the method, we apply the method to the simulations of a stationary drop, binary droplet collision, rising bubbles, and the impact of a drop on a thin liquid film (a milk crown). In a stationary drop, pressure and density profiles are computed, and the effect of sound speed on time evolution of the pressure field in the drop is illustrated. The stable computations can be performed for high density ratios up to 855. In the simulations of a binary droplet collision and rising bubbles, the computed results by the proposed method are compared with those by Inamuro et??al.???s method in good agreement. Also, the computation time of the proposed method is about 50 times faster than that of Inamuro et??al.???s method. In the simulation of a milk crown, the time evolution of the crown radius is in good agreement with theoretical predictions.},

For tubes of the same shape, the influence of tube size is quite similar. Moreover, the capillary flows in square tubes and equilateral triangle tubes have some similarity with those in circular tubes with much smaller sizes. The results are helpful for understanding the capillary flows driven by interfacial forces with different parameters.

abstract = {A stable discretization of the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) for non-ideal gases is presented for simulation of incompressible two-phase flows having high density and viscosity ratios. The stiffness of the discretized forcing terms in LBE for non-ideal gases is known to trigger severe numerical instability and restrict practical application of the LBE method. Use of a proper pressure updating scheme is also crucial to the stability of the LBE method because of non-negligible pressure variation across the phase interface. To deal with these issues, we propose a stable discretization scheme, which assumes the low Mach number approximation, and utilizes the stress and potential forms of the surface tension force, the incompressible transformation, and the consistent discretization of the intermolecular forcing terms. The proposed stable discretization scheme is applied to simulate 1-D advection equation with a source term, a stationary droplet, droplet oscillation and droplet splashing and deposition on a thin film at a density ratio of 1000 with varying Reynolds numbers. The numerical solutions of stationary and oscillatory droplets agree well with analytic solutions including the Laplace's law. The time history of the spread factor of the liquid sheet emitted after the droplet impact also follows the known spreading power law. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Based on previous experiments and the volume of fluid (VOF) multiphase model, the growth characteristics of a single bubble have been numerically investigated in a rectangular pool (10??10??25 mm3) under microgravity. The transport of mass and energy during phase change was realized by source terms of the mass and energy equations through user-defined functions (UDF). Under microgravity, the results show that the temperature and the streamline field distribution around the bubble are significantly changed as compared to the ones of terrestrial conditions. The temperature profile at the two-phase interface is no longer a uniform distribution, and the Marangoni flows are more obvious at the two-phase interface. The effects of gravity on the detachment of the bubble are significant: the bubble does not immediately detach from the heating wall under microgravity conditions. The surface tension gradient caused by the Marangoni effect is more significant at lower microgravity. Bubble growth is more complex under microgravity conditions than normal gravity conditions, and it is related to the magnitude of the microgravity: the lower the microgravity, the higher the bubble growth rate. Furthermore, under microgravity, the bubble diameter changes differently, and the fluctuation amplitude of the heat transfer coefficient increases with increasing microgravity. ?? 2014 IAA.

abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) is an alternative kinetic method capable of solving hydrodynamics for various systems. Major advantages of the method are due to the fact that the solution for the particle distribution functions is explicit, easy to implement, and natural to parallelize. Because the method often uses uniform regular Cartesian lattices in space, curved boundaries are often approximated by a series of stairs that leads to reduction in computational accuracy. In this work, a second-order accurate treatment of the boundary condition in the LBE method is developed for a curved boundary. The proposed treatment of the curved boundaries is an improvement of a scheme due to O. Filippova and D. H{\"{a}}nel (1998, J. Comput. Phys.147, 219). The proposed treatment for curved boundaries is tested against several flow problems: 2-D channel flows with constant and oscillating pressure gradients for which analytic solutions are known, flow due to an impulsively started wall, lid-driven square cavity flow, and uniform flow over a column of circular cylinders. The second-order accuracy is observed with a solid boundary arbitrarily placed between lattice nodes. The proposed boundary condition has well-behaved stability characteristics when the relaxation time is close to 1/2, the zero limit of viscosity. The improvement can make a substantial contribution toward simulating practical fluid flow problems using the lattice Boltzmann method.},

abstract = {To clarify the relation between the liquid–vapor behavior and the heat transfer characteristics in the boiling phenomena, the structures of transparent heaters were developed for both flow boiling and pool boiling experiments and were applied to the microgravity environment realized by the parabolic flight of aircraft. In the flow boiling experiment, a transparent heated tube makes the heating, the observation of liquid–vapor behavior and the measurement of heat transfer data simultaneously possible. The heat transfer coefficient in the annular flow regime at moderate quality has distinct dependence on gravity provided that the mass velocity is not so high, while no noticeable gravity effect is seen at high quality and in the bubbly flow regime. The measured gravity effect was directly related to the behavior of annular liquid film observed through the transparent tube wall. In the pool boiling experiment, a structure of transparent heating surface realizes both the observation of the macrolayer or microlayer behavior from underneath and the measurements of local surface temperatures and the layer thickness. It was clarified in the microgravity experiments that no vapor stem exists but tiny bubbles are observed in the macrolayer underneath a large coalesced bubble at high heat flux. The heat flux evaluated by the heat conduction across the layer assumes less than 30{\%} of the total to be transferred. The evaporation of the microlayers underneath primary bubbles just after the generation dominates the heat transfer in the microgravity, not only in the isolated bubble region but also in the coalesced bubble region.},

To better understand the experimental results, two-and three-dimensional simulations of the experiment were performed using level set and volume-of-fluid interface tracking algorithms. The simulations proved capable of predicting accurately the experimentally determined bubble translation behavior. Linear dependence of the bubble translation amplitude on the container translation amplitude was confirmed. In addition, the simulation model was used to confirm predictions of a theoretical inviscid model of bubble motion developed in a previous study.},

@article{Wang2015,
abstract = {Two finite difference computer models, aiming at the process predictions of no-vent fill in normal gravity and microgravity environments respectively, are developed to investigate the filling performance in a liquid hydrogen (LH2) tank. In the normal gravity case model, the tank/fluid system is divided into five control volume including ullage, bulk liquid, gas-liquid interface, ullage-adjacent wall, and liquid-adjacent wall. In the microgravity case model, vapor-liquid thermal equilibrium state is maintained throughout the process, and only two nodes representing fluid and wall regions are applied. To capture the liquid-wall heat transfer accurately, a series of heat transfer mechanisms are considered and modeled successively, including film boiling, transition boiling, nucleate boiling and liquid natural convection. The two models are validated by comparing their prediction with experimental data, which shows good agreement. Then the two models are used to investigate the performance of no-vent fill in different conditions and several conclusions are obtained. It shows that in the normal gravity environment the no-vent fill experiences a continuous pressure rise during the whole process and the maximum pressure occurs at the end of the operation, while the maximum pressure of the microgravity case occurs at the beginning stage of the process. Moreover, it seems that increasing inlet mass flux has an apparent influence on the pressure evolution of no-vent fill process in normal gravity but a little influence in microgravity. The larger initial wall temperature brings about more significant liquid evaporation during the filling operation, and then causes higher pressure evolution, no matter the filling process occurs under normal gravity or microgravity conditions. Reducing inlet liquid temperature can improve the filling performance in normal gravity, but cannot significantly reduce the maximum pressure in microgravity. The presented work benefits the understanding of the no-vent fill performance and may guide the design of on-orbit no-vent fill system.},

These include the occurrence of a "self-stabilized" cool flame that survives for more than 10 s, before dying away. Then, by integration of reaction-diffusion equations in a one-dimensional model, using a reduced kinetic scheme including very recent kinetic data for propylperoxy radical reactions derived by DeSain et al., simulations of these phenomena are presented and discussed. A validation of the reduced mechanism is given first, by simulation of multiple stage ignitions in closed vessels under spatially uniform conditions. The model is used to obtain a detailed spatial structure for temperature and selected chemical species during the development of cool flames, simulated with heat and mass diffusion in 1-D. Also included are novel approaches to the simulation of pressure change in a spherical vessel and the light output from CH2O??? chemiluminescence. The onset and spatial growth of the cool flame, and its ability to stabilize for a reasonable interval, is traced to the interaction between the elementary reactions that govern the negative temperature coefficient of reaction rate and the temperature field that is controlled by thermal diffusion to the reaction vessel walls. The vessel surface was assumed to be chemically inactive.},

@article{Renardy2002,
abstract = {Volume-of-fluid (VOF) methods are popular for the direct numerical simulation of time-dependent viscous incompressible flow of multiple liquids. As in any numerical method, however, it has its weaknesses, namely, for flows in which the capillary force is the dominant physical mechanism. The lack of convergence with spatial refinement, or convergence to a solution that is slightly different from the exact solution, has been documented in the literature. A well-known limiting case for this is the existence of spurious currents for the simulation of a spherical drop with zero initial velocity. These currents are present in all previous versions of VOF algorithms. In this paper, we develop an accurate representation of the body force due to surface tension, which effectively eliminates spurious currents. We call this algorithm PROST: parabolic reconstruction of surface tension. There are several components to this procedure, including the new body force algorithm, improvements in the projection method for the Navier–Stokes solver, and a higher order interface advection scheme. The curvature to the interface is calculated from an optimal fit for a quadratic approximation to the interface over groups of cells.},

The simplicity of formulation and its versatility explain the rapid expansion of the LB method to applications in complex and multiscale flows. We review many significant developments over the past decade with specific examples. Some of the most active developments include the entropic LB method and the application of the LB method to turbulent flow, multiphase flow, and deformable particle and fiber suspensions. Hybrid methods based on the combination of the Eulerian lattice with a Lagrangian grid system for the simulation of moving deformable boundaries show promise for more efficient applications to a broader class of problems. We also discuss higher-order boundary conditions and the simulation of microchannel flow with finite Knudsen number. Additionally, the remarkable scalability of the LB method for parallel processing is shown with examples. Teraflop simulations with the LB method are routine, and there is no doubt that this method will be one of the first candidates for petaflop computational fluid dynamics in the near future.},

The flow measurements were performed at four axial locations (axial distance from the inlet normalized by the pipe diameter = 7, 30, 45 and 60) under various flow conditions of superficial gas velocity (0.0083-0.022 m/s) and superficial liquid velocity (0.073- 0.22 m/s). The interfacial area transport mechanism under microgravity environment was discussed in detail based on the obtained data and the visual observation. These data can be used for the development of reliable constitutive relations which reflect the true transfer mechanisms in two-phase flow under microgravity environment. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The storage tank is equipped with an assembly of an inlet tube and a nozzle head that contains many nozzles on its front face. Liquid hydrogen is cooled by an external cryocooler, flows along the nozzle head assembly, penetrates into the bulk liquid through the nozzles in order to prevent the boiling off due to heat leak from the surroundings through the tank wall insulation, exits the tank through an annular outlet opening coaxial with the inlet, and then goes back to the external cooling system. Eleven cases for different geometry settings were analyzed. Typical distributions of velocity and temperature are presented. The results show that thermal performance of the system can be improved by increasing the inlet diameter and properly selecting the depth and the span of the nozzle head. ?? 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

abstract = {We propose a new lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for two-phase fluid flows with high density ratios by improving Inamuro et??al.???s method [13] without solving the pressure Poisson equation. In the proposed method, we use the lattice kinetic scheme (LKS, an extended scheme of LBM) in the same way as Inamuro et??al.???s method. The velocity and pressure fields are computed by using a single equilibrium distribution function and by adjusting the speed of sound in a high density region to satisfy the incompressible continuity equation even for high density ratios. In addition, an improved LKS is used for eliminating dissipation errors, and the continuous surface force (CSF) model is used for modeling interfacial tension of thin interfaces accurately. In order to show the validity of the method, we apply the method to the simulations of a stationary drop, binary droplet collision, rising bubbles, and the impact of a drop on a thin liquid film (a milk crown). In a stationary drop, pressure and density profiles are computed, and the effect of sound speed on time evolution of the pressure field in the drop is illustrated. The stable computations can be performed for high density ratios up to 855. In the simulations of a binary droplet collision and rising bubbles, the computed results by the proposed method are compared with those by Inamuro et??al.???s method in good agreement. Also, the computation time of the proposed method is about 50 times faster than that of Inamuro et??al.???s method. In the simulation of a milk crown, the time evolution of the crown radius is in good agreement with theoretical predictions.},

Within each application, and wherever possible, the basic principles of the technique, as well as a description of the history, instrumentation, methodology, uses, problems encountered, and advantages over the traditional, non-supercritical methods are given. Most current commercial application of the supercritical extraction involve biologically-produced materials; the technique may be particularly relevant to the extraction of biological compounds in cases where there is a requirement for low-temperature processing, high mass-transfer rates, and negligible carrying over of the solvent into the final product. Special applications to food processing include the decaffeination of green coffee beans, the production of hops extracts, the recovery of aromas and flavors from herbs and spices, the extraction and fractionation of edible oils, and the removal of contaminants, among others. New advances, in which the extraction is combined with reaction or crystallization steps, may further increase the attractiveness of supercritical fluids in the bioprocess industries. To develop and establish a novel and effective alternative to heating treatment, the lethal action of high hydrostatic pressure CO(2) on microorganisms, with none or only a minimal heating process, has recently received a great deal of attention.},

abstract = {A new approach is suggested to enhance boiling heat transfer through introduction of unusual surface tension effects. The surface tension of aqueous solutions of alcohols with a chain length longer than four carbon atoms offers a positive gradient with temperature when the temperature exceeds a certain value. Moreover, the positive gradient near the boiling point has a very large value. This will generate a considerable driving force for bubble departure. As a result, in the nucleate boiling of these solutions, the Marangoni effect around the bubble surface will not impede the bubble detachment from the heater surface but rather will provide an additional driving force for the bubble departure. This effect combines with the buoyancy under normal gravity and acts as a main driving force of bubble departure in microgravity. Models for predictions of the bubble detachment diameters, the nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficient, and the critical heat flux are developed.},

These algorithms approximate the equations of motion, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand sides, by using techniques from hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accuracy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobi-type problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems.},

abstract = {A novel lattice Boltzmann thermal model is proposed for studying thermohydrodynamics in incompressible limit. The new model introduces an internal energy density distribution function to simulate the temperature field. The macroscopic density and velocity fields are still simulated using the density distribution function. Compared with the multispeed thermal lattice Boltzmann models, the current scheme is numerically more stable. In addition, the new model can incorporate viscous heat dissipation and compression work done by the pressure, in contrast to the passive-scalar-based thermal lattice Boltzmann models. Numerical simulations of Couette flow with a temperature gradient and Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection agree well with analytical solutions and benchmark data.},

A finite element discretization is presented as well as an adaptive mesh control procedure. Numerical experiments relevant for problems in petroleum engineering and material science are presented. For these problems the surface tension is strong and conservation of mass is important. Problems in both two and three dimensions with uniform as well as non-uniform grids are studied. From these calculations convergence and conservation is studied. Good conservation and convergence are observed. ?? 2007.},

abstract = {A thermal lattice Boltzmann method based on the BGK model has been used to simulate high Rayleigh number natural convection in a square cavity. The model uses the double populations approach to simulate hydrodynamic and thermal fields. The traditional lattice Boltzmann method on a uniform grid has unreasonably high grid requirements at higher Rayleigh numbers which renders the method impractical. In this work, the interpolation supplemented lattice Boltzmann method has been utilized. This is shown to be effective even at high Rayleigh numbers. Numerical results are presented for natural convection in a square cavity with insulated horizontal walls and isothermal vertical walls maintained at different temperatures. Very fine grids (wall y+ {\textless} 0.3) have been used for the higher Rayleigh number simulations. A universal structure is shown to exist in the mean velocity turbulent boundary layer profile for y+ {\textless} 10. This agrees extremely well with previously reported experimental data. The numerical results (for Rayleigh numbers up to 1010) are in very good agreement with the benchmark results available in the literature. The highlight of the calculations is that no turbulence model has been employed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Brackbill1992,
abstract = {A new method for modeling surface tension effects on fluid motion has been developed. Interfaces between fluids of different properties, or "colors," are represented as transition regions of finite thickness, across which the color variable varies continuously. At each point in the transition region, a force density is defined which is proportional to the curvature of the surface of constant color at that point. It is normalized so that the conventional description of surface tension on an interface is recovered when the ratio of local transition region thickness to local radius of curvature approaches zero. The continuum method eliminates the need for interface reconstruction, simplifies the calculation of surface tension, enables accurate modeling of two- and three-dimensional fluid flows driven by surface forces, and does not impose any modeling restrictions on the number, complexity, or dynamic evolution of fluid interfaces having surface tension. Computational results for two-dimensional flows are given to illustrate the properties of the method. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {The motion of boiling liquid nitrogen (LN2) between electrodes and its surface profile in a microgravity environment just after release from terrestrial gravity are observed. The dynamic behaviour is analysed considering the following forces: the Maxwell stress, surface tension and viscosity, and is explained consistently by theory including these forces. The velocity of the liquid driven by the Maxwell stress and the capillary force (surface tension) is compared with that driven by the capillary force only. The growth dynamics of bubbles produced on the surface of electrodes is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1996 Elsevier Science Limited.},

@article{Leachman2009,
abstract = {If the potential for a boom in the global hydrogen economy is realized, there will be an increase in the need for accurate hydrogen thermodynamic property standards. Based on current and anticipated needs, new fundamental equations of state for parahydrogen, normal hydrogen, and orthohydrogen were developed to replace the existing property models. To accurately predict thermophysical properties near the critical region and in liquid states, the quantum law of corresponding states was applied to improve the normal hydrogen and orthohydrogen formulations in the absence of available experimental data. All three equations of state have the same maximum pressure of 2000 MPa and upper temperature limit of 1000 K. Uncertainty estimates in this paper can be considered to be estimates of a combined expanded uncertainty with a coverage factor of 2 for primary data sets. The uncertainty in density is 0.04{\%} in the region between 250 and 450 K and at pressures up to 300 MPa. The uncertainties of vapor pressures and saturated liquid densities vary from 0.1{\%} to 0.2{\%}. Heat capacities are generally estimated to be accurate to within 1{\%}, while speed-of-sound values are accurate to within 0.5{\%} below 100 MPa.},

abstract = {A new formulation for the thermodynamic properties of nitrogen has been developed. Many new data sets have become available, including high accuracy data from single and dual-sinker apparatuses which improve the accuracy of the representation of the p$\rho$T surface of gaseous, liquid, and supercritical nitrogen, including the saturation states. New measurements of the speed of sound from spherical resonators yield accurate information on caloric properties in gaseous and supercritical nitrogen. Isochoric heat capacity and enthalpy data have also been published. Sophisticated procedures for the optimization of the mathematical structure of equations of state and special functional forms for an improved representation of data in the critical region were used. Constraints regarding the structure of the equation ensure reasonable results up to extreme conditions of temperature and pressure. For calibration applications, the new reference equation is supplemented by a simple but also accurate formulation, valid only for supercritical nitrogen between 250 and 350 K at pressures up to 30 MPa. The uncertainty in density of the new reference equation of state ranges from 0.02{\%} at pressures less than 30 MPa up to 0.6{\%} at very high pressures, except in the range from 270 to 350 K at pressures less than 12 MPa where the uncertainty in density is 0.01{\%}. The equation is valid from the triple point temperature to temperatures of 1000 K and up to pressures of 2200 MPa. From 1000 to 1800 K, the equation was validated with data of limited accuracy. The extrapolation behavior beyond 1800 K is reasonable up to the limits of chemical stability of nitrogen, as indicated by comparison to experimental shock tube data.},

abstract = {This work studies the pressure control of a large cryogen storage tank in microgravity using a series of parametric numerical simulations. The complete governing equations in the liquid region are coupled to a lumped thermodynamic treatment of the vapor region. It is shown that even in microgravity buoyancy effects rapidly bring the vapor region up to the tank wall. Long-term pressurization studies show that natural convection still leads to considerable thermal stratification in the liquid. A subcooled liquid jet is used to control the pressure rise. At its lowest speed, the jet cannot penetrate far enough into the liquid region to cool the vapor because of retarding buoyancy forces. As the jet speed is increased, it is shown to be quite effective at disrupting the thermal stratification and reducing the tank pressure in a reasonable amount of time. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Ho2008,
abstract = {This paper presents a study on fluid flow and heat transfer of liquid hydrogen in a zero boil-off cryogenic storage tank in a microgravity environment. The storage tank is equipped with an active cooling system consisting of a heat pipe and a pump-nozzle unit. The pump collects cryogen at its inlet and discharges it through its nozzle onto the evaporator section of the heat pipe in order to prevent the cryogen from boiling off due to the heat leaking through the tank wall from the surroundings. A three-dimensional (3-D) finite element model is employed in a set of numerical simulations to solve for velocity and temperature fields of liquid hydrogen in steady state. Complex structures of 3-D velocity and temperature distributions determined from the model are presented. Simulations with an axisymmetric model were also performed for comparison. Parametric study results from both models predict that as the speed of the cryogenic fluid discharged from the nozzle increases, the mean or bulk cryogenic fluid speed increases linearly and the maximum temperature within the cryogenic fluid decreases. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
